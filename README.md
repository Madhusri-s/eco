This project implements an end-to-end solar photovoltaic (PV) detection pipeline using satellite imagery. It uses a hosted Roboflow object detection model to identify solar panels, generate predictions, and evaluate results. The solution is fully automated, reproducible, and designed for EcoInnovators Ideathon 2026.
